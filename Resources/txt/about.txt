SATURN WIDGET

The Saturn Widget is a utility displaying a simple planetary icon in a steampunk fashion on your desktop. It can be resized and placed anywhere on your desktop. It uses minimal resources and helps give your desktop a steampunk make-over. You can assign the widget a specific function or file to run so it acts in a similar fashion to a configurable desktop icon. It is really a bit of desktop candy with some extra capability.

Right-click on the widget to display the function menu. Mouse-hover over the widget and press CTRL+mousewheel up/down to resize. It works well on Windows XP to Windows 11+. It also operates on the open source Windows-compatible o/s, ReactOS and on Linux with Wine.

This version was developed on Windows 7 using 32 bit VisualBasic 6 as a FOSS project, creating a WoW64 widget for the desktop.

It is open source to allow easy configuration, bug-fixing, enhancement and community contribution towards free-and-useful VB6 utilities that can be created by anyone. The first step was the creation of this template program to form the basis for the conversion of other desktop utilities or 'widgets'. A future step is new VB6 widgets with more functionality and then hopefully, conversion of each to RADBasic/TwinBasic for future-proofing and 64bit-ness. 

This utility is one of a set of steampunk and dieselpunk widgets that you can find here on Deviantart: https://www.deviantart.com/yereverluvinuncleber/gallery

I do hope you enjoy using this utility and others. Your own software enhancements and contributions will be gratefully received if you choose to contribute.
