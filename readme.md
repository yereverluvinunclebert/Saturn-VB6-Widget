# Saturn-Widget-VB6
Steampunk Saturn Desktop Widget, written in VB6 for Windows and ReactOS. Created for XP, Vista, Win7, 8, 10/11+, ReactOS as well as Linux or the Apple Mac's OS/X with Wine. This Saturn Desktop Widget is an attractive dieselpunk VB6 widget for your desktop. This VB6 widget provides a simple moveable marble globe complete with rings

The others are the 'God of War', the planet Mars, Saturn and of course, the Earth. 
Double-clicking on the planet will cause a personalised Windows application 
to fire up. The first time you run it there will be no assigned function and so 
it will state as such - then it will pop up the preferences so that you can enter 
the command of your choice. The widget takes command line-style commands for
windows.

This is a simple RC/VB6 widget based upon one of my old Yahoo widgets, little more than a glorified desktop icon really. Just an image of a planetary body that responds to a double-click to open an application you choose to assign. A bit of background: The Yahoo widget SDK came with a Photoshop conversion script that could take any image and create a desktop widget within 30 seconds. This meant that you could create eye-candy desktop widgets with ease in just a few clicks. This planetary red widget is a VB6 version of one of those, demonstrating the principle of creating such a desktop widget using VB6.

Why VB6? Well, with a 64 bit, modern-language improvement upgrade on the way in the guise of 100% compatible TwinBasic, coupled with support for transparent PNGs via Olaf Schmidt's RC/Cairo wrapper, VB6 code has an amazing future.

 The Saturn widget is an attractive dieselpunk VB6 widget for your desktop. Functional and gorgeous at the same time. The graphics are my own. It is all my code with some help from the chaps at VBForums (credits given). This Widget is a moveable widget that you can move anywhere around the desktop as you require.

 This widget can be increased in size, animation speed can be changed, 
 opacity/transparency may be set as to the users discretion. The widget can 
 also be made to hide for a pre-determined period.
 
 Right clicking will bring up a menu of options. Double-clicking on the widget will cause a personalised Windows application to 
 fire up. The first time you run it there will be no assigned function and so it 
 will state as such and then pop up the preferences so that you can enter the 
 command of your choice. The widget takes command line-style commands for 
 windows. Mouse hover over the widget and press CTRL+mousewheel up/down to resize. It works well on Windows XP 
 to Windows 11.
 
 ![about](https://github.com/yereverluvinunclebert/Saturn-VB6-Widget/assets/2788342/6b8ea9af-a75b-4f82-9bfc-03e563ae17b7)

 The Saturn VB6 widget is Beta-grade software, under development, not yet 
 ready to use on a production system - use at your own risk.

 This version was developed on Windows 7 using 32 bit VisualBasic 6 as a FOSS 
 project creating a WoW64 widget for the desktop. 
 
 It is open source to allow easy configuration, bug-fixing, enhancement and 
 community contribution towards free-and-useful VB6 utilities that can be created
 by anyone. The first step was the creation of this template program to form the 
 basis for the conversion of other desktop utilities or widgets. A future step 
 is new VB6 widgets with more functionality and then hopefully, conversion of 
 each to RADBasic/TwinBasic for future-proofing and 64bit-ness.

 This utility is one of a set of steampunk and dieselpunk widgets. That you can 
 find here on Deviantart: https://www.deviantart.com/yereverluvinuncleber/gallery
 
 I do hope you enjoy using this utility and others. Your own software 
 enhancements and contributions will be gratefully received if you choose to 
 contribute.

 I have really tried to maintain the credits as the project has progressed. If I 
 have made a mistake and left someone out then do forgive me. I will make amends 
 if anyone points out my mistake in leaving someone out.
 
 MicroSoft in the 90s - MS built good, lean and useful tools in the late 90s and 
 early 2000s. Thanks for VB6.
 
 Olaf Schmidt - This tool was built using the RichClient RC5 Cairo wrapper for 
 VB6. Specifically the components using transparency and reading images directly 
 from PSD. Thanks for the massive effort Olaf in creating Cairo counterparts for 
 all VB6 native controls and giving us access to advanced features on controls 
 such as transparency.
 
 Shuja Ali @ codeguru for his settings.ini code.
 
 ALLAPI.COM        For the registry reading code.

 Dependencies:
 
 o A windows-alike o/s such as Windows XP, 7-11, ReactOS or Linux/Wine, Apple Mac OSX 11+ Wine. 
 
 o Microsoft VB6 IDE installed with its runtime components. The program runs 
 without any additional Microsoft OCX components, just the basic controls that 
 ship with VB6.

 * Uses the latest version of the RC6 Cairo framework from Olaf Schmidt.
 
 During development the RC6 components need to be registered. These scripts are 
 used to register. Run each by double-clicking on them.
 
	RegisterRC6inPlace.vbs
	RegisterRC6WidgetsInPlace.vbs
 
 During runtime on the users system, the RC6 components are dynamically 
 referenced using modRC6regfree.bas which is compiled into the binary.	
 
 
 Requires a Saturn folder in C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\ 
 eg: C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\Saturn
 Requires a settings.ini file to exist in C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\Saturn
 The above will be created automatically by the compiled program when run for the 
 first time.
 
 Uses just one OCX control extracted from Krools mega pack (slider). This is part 
 of Krools replacement for the whole of Microsoft Windows Common Controls found 
 in mscomctl.ocx. The slider control OCX file is shipped with this package.
 
 * CCRSlider.ocx
 
 This OCX will reside in the program folder. The program reference to this OCX is 
 contained within the supplied resource file Saturn.RES. It is 
 compiled into the binary.
 
 * OLEGuids.tlb
 
 This is a type library that defines types, object interfaces, and more specific 
 API definitions needed for COM interop / marshalling. It is only used at design 
 time (IDE). This is a Krool-modified version of the original .tlb from the 
 vbaccelerator website. The .tlb is compiled into the executable.
 For the compiled .exe this is NOT a dependency, only during design time.
 
 From the command line, copy the tlb to a central location (system32 or wow64 
 folder) and register it.
 
 COPY OLEGUIDS.TLB %SystemRoot%\System32\
 REGTLIB %SystemRoot%\System32\OLEGUIDS.TLB
 
 In the VB6 IDE - project - references - browse - select the OLEGuids.tlb
 


 * SETUP.EXE - The program is currently distributed using setup2go, a very useful 
 and comprehensive installer program that builds a .exe installer. Youll have to 
 find a copy of setup2go on the web as it is now abandonware. Contact me
 directly for a copy. The file "install Saturn 0.1.0.s2g" is the configuration 
 file for setup2go. When you build it will report any errors in the build.
 
 * HELP.CHM - the program documentation is built using the NVU HTML editor and 
 compiled using the Microsoft supplied CHM builder tools (HTMLHelp Workshop) and 
 the HTM2CHM tool from Yaroslav Kirillov. Both are abandonware but still do
 the job admirably. The HTML files exist alongside the compiled CHM file in the 
 HELP folder.
